The field of soft-body deformations has existed since the 1980's. Due to limitations of the time,
simulation of soft-body deformations couldn't be performed in real-time. As a result, it was only 
suitable for tasks that could be done offline, such as animation. However, with the advent of 
modern computing hardware and advances in soft-body deformation research real-time speeds are now
possible. These advances have made soft-body deformations more appealing to tasks such as surgery 
simulation and video games.

This proposal discusses a technique for soft-body deformations based on voxelized meshes, a brief
background of research done in the field, a proposed extension to the voxelized mesh technique, a 
hypothesis on how the extension will fare against the existing technique, and the design of a system
that will be used to compare the proposed extension and the original technique.
