\chapter{Implementation}

\subsection{Hypothesis Validation}

To Validate the claims made in the hypothesis, the original technique described by MÃ¼ller \etal and
the proposed extension will need to be implemented. These implementations will then be used to 
collect data for evaluating the hypothesis.

\subsection{Design}

The original technique and the proposed extensions will be implemented as two applications. The 
first application will be used to generate the voxel-meshes that are needed by both techniques. The
second application will perform the physics simulation. This approach was chosen to remove the need
for voxelization, which can be a costly operation when implemented in a naive fashion, to occur at
simulation run time.

\subsection{Libraries and APIs}

Both applications will make use of a number of libraries and APIs to achieve their respective goals. 
The following is a comprehensive list of the libraries that will be used:

% TODO: links
\begin{itemize}
  \item Bullet Physics: An open source physics engine.
  \item OpenGL: The Open Graphics Library.
  \item GLM: A math library compatible with GLSL math functions.
  \item GLAD: An OpenGL extension loader.
  \item nlohmann/json.hpp: An open source json library for C++.
  \item Dear ImGui: A simple to use, immediate-mode GUI library.
\end{itemize}

% \begin{itemize}
% \item{} Software details (use as many section as needed for class design, 
% database tables, middleware, etc.)

% \item{} Make sure you present and comment on any interesting issues about
% your implementation that you are proud of or unhappy with

% \item{} Skip code listing and specific UML diagrams, etc. to an appendix
